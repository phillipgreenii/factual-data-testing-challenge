absolute method
create object that will extract attribute about the string

simple extractors
* TODO extract used to check for uniqueness of values
* length, 
* TODO pattern(###-##-####)
* numeric value, 
* composition 
** numbers
** lower case letters
** upper case letters
** white space
** special characters
* has leading space
* has trailing space
deeper extractors
* TODO phone number extractor
* TODO date time extractor
* time (duration) extractor
* address extractor
* TODO location extractor 
** gps coordinates could be used to know if locations are "near" each other

once attributes have been extracted from each line they can be aggregated to determine the expected values
a stretch goal would be to look for patterns of a combination of attributes (this might entail needing to cluster)
we may need to use a normal curve to determine if the values are expected or not.  If I remember correctly, there are tests for different distributions, so instead of assuming normal, we could test for a couple different distributions
the output from this step won't be exepected values, but a function that can determine if a string matches the expected values

Once the expected values are known, we iterate through the lines again and dump out outliers
